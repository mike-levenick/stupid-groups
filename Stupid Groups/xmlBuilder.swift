     This section will first use an anonymous hash/tuple to "translate" the human readable dropdowns into
     a more computer readable format.
     
     The values here typically directly translate into what the XML expects to see on a PUT or POST
     however some are simply identifiable placeholders. The logic statements below help to determine which XML format
     should be built and used for the upload, depending on what is being done. The various methods of building the xml
     are mostly due to how different various JSS API endpoints behave, and how the xml format differs between them.
     For example, sites are under the general subset, in a site sub-subset for ios and mac, but simply in the sites subset for users
